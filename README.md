# Pygame-Experiments
A collection of small Pygame projects/experiments that i will add to over time. Currently has a small 2D gravity simulation that is accurate physically and a simple 2D water "simulation" although its more just a cheap way to make some decent looking water the simulation side of it is not accurate at all.
